## How to use the beta with docker

To use the beta with docker you can use the following docker-compose.yml configuration:

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
#     Homarr - A simple, yet powerful dashboard for your server.      #
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
services:
  homarr:
    container_name: homarr
    image: ghcr.io/homarr-labs/homarr:beta
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # Optional, only if you want docker integration
      - ./homarr/appdata:/appdata
    environment:
      - SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_64_character_hex_string # <--- can be generated with `openssl rand -hex 32`
    ports:
      - '7575:7575'
```

Then, run `docker compose up -d` in the same directory. This will start the Homarr container in the background.
Please note that the mounts have changed and it's not backwards compatible with versions before 1.0.0-beta.1.
